üìò Project: Improving Application Software Usability Through Effective Prompt Engineering

This project is based on a bachelor‚Äôs thesis that explores how Prompt Engineering can enhance the usability and accessibility of AI-powered applications, particularly those utilizing language models like ChatGPT.
üéØ Objective

The main goal is to develop a scalable and user-friendly software framework that simplifies interactions with AI models. This is done by:

    Applying prompt engineering patterns to improve AI responses.

    Designing a system that allows non-technical users to generate high-quality outputs without writing complex prompts.

    Using microservices architecture to ensure the system is modular, extensible, and future-proof.

üí° Key Concepts

    Prompt Engineering: Crafting well-structured prompts to optimize AI model performance.

    AI Usability: Making AI systems easier to use for tasks like content creation, especially in marketing.

    OOP : Breaking down the system into small, independent services (e.g., content generation, web scraping, summarization).

    UI/UX: Emphasis on user interface design for intuitive interactions.

    Framework Flexibility: Integration with multiple LLMs (ChatGPT-3.5/4, Gemini, etc.), allowing task-specific agent assignment.

üõ† Use Case

The framework powers a content creation tool for marketing teams (e.g., at Billwerk+). Users can:

    Choose from predefined styles and templates.

    Automatically generate blog posts or summaries.

    Scrape and analyze competitor websites.

    Receive structured and human-like content‚Äîfast.

‚úÖ System Requirements & App Flow
üß© Functional Requirements

    Platform Architecture

        Create a scalable AI platform for internal organizational use.

        Focus initially on building the Content Creation Tool.

        Use a OOP architecture to support modular tools.

    Content Creation Tool

        Analyze and summarize competitor content.

        Allow users to generate articles with:

            Article type (e.g. blog, newsletter)

            Tone and style (e.g. formal, friendly)

            Supplementary input like questions

        Answer user-defined questions within the article.

    Competitor Analysis

        Scrape competitor articles and store them in a database.

        Break down each article into tokens (content segments).

        Generate mind map summaries for each article.

    Articles Hub

        Display all analyzed articles with categorized summaries.

        Allow searching by category and keywords.

        Enable users to manage content idea milestones:

            Save/delete emerging content ideas from new articles.

    Prompt System

        Use different prompt engineering patterns:

            Prompt Templates

            Reversal Pattern

            Prompt Chaining

            Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

            Contextualization

        Provide editable prompt templates for different use cases (definitions, comparisons, etc.).

    User Interaction

        Simple UI/UX with sidebar navigation for non-technical users.

        Token-level editing: change tone, structure, or call-to-action dynamically.

        One-click article generation from final tokens.

        Provide feedback mechanism (rate tools or report issues).

    Model Integration

        API-based integration with multiple NLP models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMA2).

        Allow flexible model switching depending on agent tasks and token size support.

    External API Integration

        Allow connections with social media and third-party APIs for content distribution or enrichment.

‚öôÔ∏è Non-Functional Requirements

    Usability: Clean, intuitive interface for content creators.

    Scalability: Easily add new tools or NLP models in the future.

    Integration: Easy connection with various NLP models and external services.

    Performance: Efficient handling of content generation, analysis, and summarization processes.
