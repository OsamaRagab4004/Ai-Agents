Table of Contents New business models require new software Subscription software improves the subscription lifecycle From CRM systems to marketing automation to data analytics – specific business operations require specific platforms and tools to work efficiently and flexibly. Subscription business models are no exception. The subscription economy is growing. Video-on-demand alone is supposed to grow from 99 billion dollars revenue worldwide in 2022 to 124 billion in 2028 (source: Statista). Software-as-a-Service is even predicted to grow more, with an increase of 18% global user spending from 2023 to 2024 (197 billion US-Dollar vs. 232 US-Dollar). And amidst trends such as the sharing or circular economy as well as new business models that have gained traction in the last years (food kits, surprise boxes, etc.), it’s safe to say that subscription models are and will be a core element of any market in the 21st century for both B2B and B2C businesses. New business models require new software But as with every big movement within business operations, a subscription business model needs its own specific set of tools and platforms so users/employees can create the right offers and purchase flows to attract customers and increase conversion rates. For example, the explosion of different communication channels has spurred a growth in specified marketing automation platforms and CRM applications. They enable marketing and sales teams to gain an overview of all customer channels, manage different communication strategies on one platform, connect workflows for customer journeys and track and measure KPIs. Likewise, subscription offers require a solution that fits the business model. Subscriptions are rarely static, they expand and change with development cycles, customer demands, market fluctuations and revenue impact. Customers purchase and keep on purchasing on a regular basis but these recurring contracts need to be seamless and effortless for customers who expect simplicity and flexibility. On the other hand, subscription companies need to be able to adjust pricing models, discounts and coupons to react to market trends, marketing data, and seasonal trends (e.g., Black Friday, Christmas, etc.). Subscription software improves the subscription lifecycle Subscription management software is designed to support with the entire subscription lifecycle and is optimized to offer an intuitive experience for customers on the one side and fast insights and efficient processes for users. A CRM or ERP tool that also offers a few subscription functionalities will never have the resources to fully concentrate on technological development, customer trends, and crucial requirements regarding subscriptions whereas a subscription vendor is 100% focused to create a sleek, efficient and varied platform that adapts to your business, your markets, and your customers. Easy management and customizing of offers (with different subscription models, add-ons, and features). A variety of discounts, coupons, free trials, and other incentives to entice new customers or reward existing customers for their loyalty. Payment automation and a wide selection of payment methods to be able to scale internationally. Dunning communication flow for easy and customer-centric handling of unpaid or failed invoices. An intuitive and branded front-end for customers that gives an overview of all offers, helps with the selection and creates a painless checkout experience. Want to find the right software?

Published: December 22, 2023 Author: juliane waack Trends & Guides Ownership is at the heart of commerce but in the wake of increasing prices, climate change, and new technologies, a sharing economy has opened up - and could create a more sustainable market philosophy. Table of Contents What is a circular economy? Advantages & Example Usership demands access Sharing is caring Subscriptions enable sharing Ownership is at the heart of commerce but in the wake of increasing prices, climate change, and new technologies, a sharing economy has opened up – and could create a more sustainable market philosophy. What is a circular economy? A circular economy aims at a more sustainable economy, from the supply chain to the market up to the longevity of its products. As such, its main principles are: durability (the product lasts longer) reuse (the product is not just for a one-time use) remanufacturing (the product can be rebuilt with old and new components for lesser waste) recycling (waste can be turned into new resources and materials for production, etc.) Aside from the many aspects of a circular economy that cover the manufacturing and delivering of products (e.g., alternative resources, lower energy consumption, closer production centers, shorter delivery routes, etc.), the user-side is just as important to uphold the principles of the circular economy. Whereas ownership has been a staple of the economy for decades if not centuries, the past years have shown an increase in business models that are more based on sharing goods and services. Advantages & Example to keep prices low, to increase the usage of otherwise “idle assets”, to shift individual responsibility for products to the vendor who suddenly has a much higher interest in the longevity of their products. Example: A car vendor usually does not need to make sure that their customers keep their new cars in good condition. In fact, if the customers are in need of a new car a few years after purchasing, it would even benefit the vendor’s business. The manager of a car sharing service, however, takes maintenance services over from the customer and has a much higher interest in the longevity of the fleet because the longer his cars can be used by his customers, the more he gets out of his initial investment in the cars. Usership demands access Usership has truly changed or at least expanded business models and opened up the market to new opportunities which could lead to long-lasting changes in the way we treat the product and usage lifecycle. Especially retail has a huge impact on our carbon footprint from packaging waste to shorter “trend” cycles and concepts such as “fast fashion” and “planned obsolescence” which basically incorporate waste-for-profit into business models by manufacturing products that are bound to have a shorter durability only to increase the need to purchase newer replacements. With companies making it more difficult for consumers to repair their own products, waste has increased over the years. According to Business Insider, fast fashion is responsible for a whopping 10% of all carbon emissions globally with 85% of all textiles being thrown away. Sharing is caring In contrast to these wasteful trends, the circular economy as well as the focus on usership instead of ownership aim to shift the consumer’s perspective of why they even buy products in the first place: to use them. Ownership is mainly needed to guarantee access when the product is needed. But if business models allow for reliable access and add options and choices to the offer, users could gain a lot more through sharing many different products and services instead of owning them. A great example is the Danish Wardrobe Collective, which supports the sharing of clothing items. The collective is responsible for the logistics and the management of local stores in Denmark, and they provide an app to see store locations as well as manage the member profile. Members pay a monthly fee to access these stores where they hand in their “old” clothes to gain points which they can then use to pick “new” clothes from any of the available stores. Subscriptions enable sharing Subscription-based business models are at the heart of usership whether users pay a monthly fee to gain access to a resource (and often additional services) or keep a free account to pay only when they use a product (e.g., car sharing, Airbnb). Even subscription models that don’t feature physical products can decrease the carbon footprint. For example, cloud-based services initially started out when companies such as Amazon realized that they could simply “rent out” their unused servers via the cloud. That way, the energy consumption of these servers was not wasted, and other companies didn’t need to maintain their own servers. In any case, subscriptions usually not only allow access to the product or service itself. In many cases, they gain access to a community, to further support and information, and their own interactions and feedback can even directly impact the development of the products and services itself. For example, Billwerk+ closely listens to its users when it comes to the product roadmaps and the prioritization of planned features. The more users ask for a specific feature, the higher it goes up the priority list (as long as it fits the product scope). The marketing automation platform HubSpot works similarly with their community page where users can openly request features which can be upvoted by other users to show interest. Usership, and in relation subscription membership, is therefore not just a shift away from product ownership but also towards a more engaged communication with a business – if done well. As such, it offers a symbiotic relationship that is – just like its core philosophy – circular. Read in our newest Subscription Industry Report: From Ownership to Usership – The Rise of Circular Economy in Europe, how you can align your subscription business model with circular principles."}]}

So-called subscription fatigue is a new phenomenon that can challenge companies and customers alike. Table of Contents What is subscription Fatigue? Symptoms of B2C subscription fatigue: Symptoms of B2B SaaS fatigue: What can you do against subscription fatigue? 1. Know your customers 2. Focus on your USPs 3. Strive for transparency 4. Excel with your support & services 5. Engage with your customers & create relationships 6. Nurture your existing customers 7. Experiment with your pricing and subscription plans What is subscription Fatigue? Subscription fatigue describes feelings of being overwhelmed and frustrated with the massive amount of different subscription services available. It has been mainly used in regards to streaming and online publications. However, it can also be applied to software-as-a-service, product subscriptions and other subscription-based business models. Even with affordable subscriptions, many consumers feel as if they’re losing control over the total amount of money that they spend each month (or year) on subscriptions. In cases of different streaming and publication services, it can even get to a point where consumers see diminishing returns since they’re using each service less the more other services they subscribe to. Symptoms of B2C subscription fatigue: Lacking overview of all subscriptions Perceived redundancies when it comes to different subscriptions that fill the same need (e.g., streaming) Price increases across the board Perceived (and real) limitations of features (e.g., Netflix and Co cracking down on password sharing and reducing their content libraries) Evaluating the best offers has become more difficult with more market players Prices of all subscriptions stack up when combined But it’s not just B2C subscription markets that might have to find ways to convince consumers of their products and services. According to a Bettercloud report from 2020 (PDF), the average number of SaaS apps used by a single company was 80. It’s only logical to assume that this number has increased in the last three years, with remote work and the pandemic-push for digitalization having pushed the use of cloud-based solutions. However, for companies, these numbers also bring real challenges with them, that in parts are similar to consumer challenges. Symptoms of B2B SaaS fatigue: Lacking overview of all applications for the IT team Prices stack despite relatively low individual prices Price increases have also occurred across the SaaS market If the applications are not properly connected, they create data silos and can cause security risks Too many applications can also circumvent branding and process standards Since the decision-making for SaaS solutions has moved from the IT department to business units, it’s more likely that different teams use similar/redundant applications If not properly connected, too many applications can cause an increase in manual work (e.g., to find, move, and synchronize data). What can you do against subscription fatigue? 1. Know your customers The more the merrier? When it comes to subscriptions, it’s far better to know which customer groups and buyer personas are more likely to subscribe and stay loyal than to just use the free trial or subscribe only for a few months. The good news: you can easily gain this info from your own customer data. Simply look at your most loyal customers and define what they have in common. This way, you can focus your marketing and sales campaigns on their profiles and increase your revenue. 2. Focus on your USPs Make it easy for leads to make a decision by providing them with values and advantages that the competition can’t offer. These don’t have to be service or product features only, a great service, a sustainable business model, excellent data security or low downtimes can be amazing reasons to choose you. Additionally, analyze what people criticize about your competition and see where you already do better – that way, you make sure that your USPs are addressing real pain points. 3. Strive for transparency When it comes to pricing, service fees, add-ons and price increases, you have to be transparent because you’re not just selling a one-time paid product or service, you’re selling a long-term commitment and relationship with you as a company. Trust is pretty much synonymous with transparency of your pricing plans, your strategy, potential future updates and changes as well as service level agreements. By the way, transparency also helps your customers when it comes to comparing different solutions. Realistic expectations ultimately support your bottom line. 4. Excel with your support & services No matter what level of support you’re offering, make sure that the quality of it is high. Quantity is not necessary, e.g., you don’t have to provide services on all channels but instead choose the channels where you can provide the best service. If you offer self-service, take a customer-centric view and identify the areas that customers actually require. For example, customers might prefer to easily log in and see their subscription plans and manage them as they like, along with their payment data (pause, cancel, down- or upgrade). On the other hand, when it comes to issues with the service or product itself, an additional contact channel with human support can prevent frustration pre-emptively. 5. Engage with your customers & create relationships Whether in B2B or B2C, since it’s quite likely/preferrable that your consumers and customers engage with your product a lot, you have endless opportunities to engage with them in turn. From the wording of your help center, transactional emails and marketing materials, up to newsletters, events, and loyalty programs – subscription businesses have the unique opportunity to stay in contact with their customers and therefore foster loyalty. However, make sure that these engagements are coherent with your brand voice across all channels – yes, this includes dunning management, support issues and even bad reviews. It’s important to be open, inspiring, and customer-oriented across all customer touchpoints – especially the ones that cause friction. 6. Nurture your existing customers Remember when internet and phone companies used to do everything in their power to gain new customers and offered the best contracts, discounts and free trials to them? Well, it’s the same in many subscription markets but don’t forget that your existing customers do see these offers too and wonder why they have to pay more even if they’ve invested much more into your company. There are different ways to show gratefulness to your loyal customers: loyalty programs, exclusive offers, vouchers, special service agreements, etc. SaaS might invite loyal customers to test out sparkling new beta features while subscription boxes could add a little extra now and then to show their appreciation. Never forget that at the core of a successful subscription business is not just the amount of customers but also their customer lifetime value. And to appreciate their commitment, goes a long way to keep them excited about you. 7. Experiment with your pricing and subscription plans Last but clearly not least is one of the most important parts: your product. Another huge advantage of subscription businesses is the fact that you have insights into long-term user data which you can analyze to find out what features are most popular, what pricing models work best, which incentives are most attractive for first-time customers and which ones are attractive to upgrade plans. Experiment with your products and pricing models for your campaigns, involve your customers when it comes to further developments, and don’t be afraid to play around with incentives to find the perfect combination for conversion vs. ROI.

Top Benefits of E-commerce Subscriptions Enjoy Predictable Revenue Spend Less on Customer Acquisition Enhanced Upselling and Cross-Selling Do Your Products Make Sense for a Subscription Box? Why Reinvent the Wheel? Simplify Subscription Management with Billwerk+ Businesses worldwide have recognized the power of subscription boxes. What began as a way to sell affordable razors quickly evolved into an entire box ecosystem that gives consumers recurring deliveries for the products and services they want most. So, what do the numbers say? The popularity of these services is due to both consumer demand and the meaningful benefits they offer. Research shows that the global subscription box market reached US$22.7 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach US$65 billion by 2027 — highlighting the huge opportunity that exists for businesses in virtually all industries. So, have you considered starting a subscription business or adding subscription boxes to your existing Ecommerce store? There’s never been a better time to get started. Summertime is the perfect season to launch your next big subscription box idea. Why? Because consumers looking to simplify their lives during the business of summer are more likely to splurge on luxurious products. And when the summer ends, your subscription keeps going. What Exactly is a Subscription Business? Subscription boxes are a unique service that offers customers a convenient, often personalised, and cost-effective box filled with items they want or need. Subscription boxes, sometimes called customer clubs, began with Dollar Shave Club – a service that offered razors and shaving items every month. The company had astounding success and launched an entire business model. Yet, subscriptions aren’t a new concept. Magazine subscriptions have been popular since 1898, and several companies had success with CD subscriptions in the 1990’s. It’s a business model that’s ensured recurring revenue for media companies for over a century. But it wasn’t until online shopping became the norm that the modern spin on subscription services took root. Now, consumers can subscribe to receive easy-to-make healthy dinners, the clothes they wear to work, and a never-ending supply of coffee. Create a Test Account Today! Start the free trial Top Benefits of E-commerce Subscriptions There’s a lot for consumers to love about subscription boxes. Some provide recurring deliveries of products they regularly buy, while others let them experience new items they might never discover otherwise. But why do businesses love e-commerce subscriptions? Of course, the exact benefits will depend on the subscription box model you pick, but let’s explore some universal business benefits appreciated by all of them. Enjoy Predictable Revenue The most potent benefit of this business model is securing predictable monthly revenue. Unlike traditional e-commerce stores that rely on single purchases, subscriptions provide a straightforward recurring revenue stream. Predictable revenue creates a consistent baseline for your business, with single purchases or upsells allowing for added revenue. You’ll rest easy knowing that you can cover your operating costs and understand how much you’ll have every month to re-invest in the business. Spend Less on Customer Acquisition Traditional e-commerce stores are constantly investing in customer acquisition. However, once customers are earned, they might only make a single purchase and never return. Subscriptions allow these same marketing efforts to earn customers that are inherently repeat customers. Additionally, as long as you provide quality products and reliable shipping, you can turn customers into extremely loyal brand advocates. They may refer friends to your customer club, earning the highly sought-after word-of-mouth marketing. You’ll still need to market your business, of course, but your business won’t be reliant on a constant stream of new customers to survive. Enhanced Upselling and Cross-Selling It’s common for subscription boxes to have several tiers of boxes, and many customers start with the lowest tier to try it out. However, if they love what you’re offering, they may upgrade on their own to a higher tier. That’s not the only way to upsell, though. The frequent customer contact in subscription services creates repeated opportunities to upsell higher tiers and cross-sell one-time add-ons. If your subscription box complements a broader online store, you can offer your box subscribers other products with special discounts or promos. Curious About our Subscription Management Service? Learn more Do Your Products Make Sense for a Subscription Box? Some products simply don’t make sense for a subscription box. For example, products that a consumer would generally buy once every few years aren’t typically a great fit for this business model. Additionally, boxes filled with non-consumable novelty items can experience success but may struggle to retain customers. On the other end of the spectrum, some niches are oversaturated with subscription boxes, and entering the market may prove difficult. For example, the meal-kit category is particularly oversaturated since these products are a perfect fit for subscriptions. Yet, other businesses are already dominating the market, and the meal-kit category has one of the highest cancellation rates. You’ll need to do significant research before launching your box. You need to see what else is out there, what’s failing, what’s succeeding, and how many businesses are already serving that niche. In addition, you’ll need to make sure you secure excellent wholesale prices and that your subscription rates are competitive and profitable. Why Reinvent the Wheel? Simplify Subscription Management with Billwerk+ Are you ready to launch your summertime subscription box? You may be well on the road to success, but don’t think you need to pave the road yourself.

Plus, with our powerful plug-ins that provide everything you need for subscription management, starting your own subscription box is easier than ever!

Besides its primary function as an “anomaly detector”, account reconciliation helps to avoid any kind of discrepancy, hereby the main important ones: Accuracy of financial records: Account reconciliation helps ensure the accuracy and integrity of an organization’s financial records. This accuracy is crucial for producing reliable financial statements and reports, which are vital for decision-making, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder confidence. Fraud detection and prevention: Discrepancies in transactions, unauthorized withdrawals, or unexpected charges can be early indicators of fraudulent behavior. Regulatory compliance: Companies have a legal obligation to maintain accurate financial records and comply with accounting standards and regulations.

Cash flow management: account reconciliation ensures that cash inflows and outflows are accurately recorded and accounted for. It helps identify any missing deposits or unrecorded payments, enabling businesses to have an accurate understanding of their cash position. Error identification and resolution: account reconciliation allows businesses to identify and rectify errors in their financial records. It could be a simple data entry mistake, a misclassified transaction, or a discrepancy between the company’s records and the bank’s records.

A Visa payment card token replaces sensitive payment card data, such as the card number, expiration date, and CVV, with the unique identifier called a token. The token is a secure generated identification number, that heavily reduces the risk of theft or fraud during transactions and simplifies the payment process for merchants while securing customer information. The actual card data is hidden underneath the token, and never used in transactions. When the tokenised Visa cards are replaced by new cards, they will be automatically updated in the card scheme systems. Why use Visa Token Service? By saving the customers cards for recurring purchases in your e-commerce or subscription service, you create a more streamlined and better buyers experience for your customers. But with saved cards, also called card on file, and subscription payments comes the hassle of reminding procedures for customers to update their expired cards – and this is where Visa Token Service will become a great pain reliever for you! Get higher retention Reduce lost revenue Increase customer satisfaction with token service Benefits of Visa Token Service Improving your Visa recurring payments process to make it more secure and streamlined can help businesses increase customer trust and loyalty, leading to increased revenue and growth opportunities. Our partnership with Visa for Visa Token Service gives you an even greater level of protection for you and your customers throughout the entire payment journey: Payment automation The automatic update of cards provides a smoother payment experience for your recurring customers. Because of this they don’t have to remember to manually update outdated cards, or risk losing out on the products or services they enjoy with you due to outdated payment card data. As a result, the customer experience becomes more pleasant and positive, and will certainly save you some customer service phone calls from customers with payment problems! Fraud protection Visa states that tokenisation is one of the payment industry’s best defence against payment fraud, and we can only agree. Digital tokens are worthless to a fraudster, since they have no way to access and use the real payment card data. No more “ghost subscribers” With Visa Token Service activated you as a merchant won’t have to worry about loss of income from rejected payment due to expired card data. Similarly, this makes it convenient and easier for you as a consumer, as you don’t need to manually update your Visa card in your favourite e-commerce or on your subscription services such as media streaming, newspaper, box subscriptions and so on. Let’s use an example: Company X has worked hard on onboarding their subscribers. Let’s call them LifeBox. Their conversion rate is high and the company has an average CLV of 18 months. 15% of the subscribers are very active, 70% of them are using the solution once in a while and the last 15% is with a low interaction. The so-called ‘ghost subscribers’. Not ideal, but okay. LifeBox has calculated that their CAC is around €12 and that the spend is higher than €500 a year. A good business. But, the dropout of subscribers is high. They lose around 5% of their business due to the cancellation of subscriptions. Not only just because of user action but due to an expired card. Their e-commerce manager has worked hard on the ‘get back’ campaigns along with spending on retargeting. Nevertheless, the customers seem to struggle to update their cards. Not only due to the user interface that is not always working but also due to the urgency. With the new token service from Visa, the struggle is over. Now the subscription is no longer expired or creating troubles for the customer or for LifeBox, but now the only concern that is left for the e-commerce manager is to keep the ghost subscriber happy and find the value in the product.

Table of Contents The difference between acquiring agreements and acquiring service Acquiring agreement Acquiring service Merchant acquiring - a necessary safety net From a customer’s point of view, a payment transaction is an uncomplicated process that often only involves a quick tap of their card. But behind the simple transaction is a complex system of financial institutions that work together to make the transaction possible, with the acquiring bank as the key component in the payment process machinery. The acquiring bank provides the merchants with all the necessary tools for payment processing, allowing the merchants to accept digital payments, expand their customer base, improve customer experience, and increase sales. Acquiring gives merchants several benefits, such as: More payment options: credit and debit cards, electronic payments and more Streamlined payment process, letting the merchants focus on their business Secure risk management systems to reduce the risk of fraud Enhanced customer experience, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty The difference between acquiring agreements and acquiring service In this blog post, we are talking about acquiring agreements and acquiring service. So, what is the difference between an acquiring agreement and an acquiring service? Acquiring agreement An acquiring agreement is a legal contract between a merchant and an acquiring bank or payment service provider that outlines the terms and conditions of the payment processing services. It includes details such as the types of payment methods supported, processing fees, settlement schedules, and dispute resolution procedures. The agreement also sets out the responsibilities of both parties, including compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Acquiring service An acquiring service is a financial service that, among other services, includes the acquiring agreement and enables merchants to accept and process electronic payments from their customers. By using an acquiring service such as the Billwerk+ acquiring service, you can simplify the payment process, improve your cash flow, and increase sales by offering customers more convenient and secure payment options, combined in one easy-to-use product package with your Billwerk+ payment gateway and subscription management administration. As Billwerk+ collaborates independently with several acquiring banks, our acquiring service can match you with the best possible acquiring deal for your business needs, giving you access to the payment methods your customers want. Acquiring services can support a wide range of payment methods, and provide additional services for the merchant, such as: Credit and debit cards E-wallets Direct debit Bank transfers Fraud prevention Chargeback management Reconciliation reporting Merchant acquiring – a necessary safety net As the acquiring bank enables the merchants to accept various forms of payment methods and manages the payment processes, having an acquiring agreement is necessary as a merchant. In general, merchants need an acquiring agreement to be able to accept card payments. This agreement outlines the terms and conditions for accepting card payments and provides the necessary tools and resources for secure payment processing. It is not recommended to accept card payments without a proper acquiring agreement in place, as it can result in legal and financial risks. Having an acquiring agreement is thus a necessary safety net that any merchant would not want to be without. When the merchant uses the acquiring service from Billwerk+, they not only get the acquiring agreement best suited for their business, but they are also ensured that the complexity of the payment process and fraud prevention is handled securely and compliant with PCI DSS, and that they get the needed access to the acquiring bank’s relationships with payment card networks such as Visa, Mastercard, Dankort, American Express etc. To get a merchant acquiring account with Billwerk+, your website needs to fulfil some requirements.

Rather, the question is: How do I make the most of my live shows? By now, live shopping has taken the world by storm, and many brands and retailers have incorporated it in their sales and marketing strategy. Therefore, it’s time to strategize… Table of Contents #1 Hype, hype, hype #2 Utilize all your channels at once #3 Co-host your live shows with influencers #4 Use digital overlays for a professional look-and-feel #5 Keep it personal and interactive #6 Mix it up with theme-based live events #7 First come, first served and other exclusive offers Summary Brands and businesses are often curious to know what they can achieve with live shopping. But there is not one final answer to that question, since it depends on a long series of factors, including your industry, the size of your business, your target group, and many more. But why not focus on the aspects you have the power to influence? One thing is certain: Your own effort and approach to live selling has a major impact on your success with live shopping. So, let’s start there. Without further ado, let’s dive into 7 ways to increase your revenue with live shopping. #1 Hype, hype, hype If you work in marketing, you know that hype is not something to take for granted. It’s no coincidence that Apple hosts major launch parties whenever a new phone is being released. It works, and consumers go into an event or buy a product with lots of excitement and anticipation. The same goes for your live shows. Build up hype before your live shows to make consumers curious and eager to participate. The results? More views, likes, comments, and shares – and more revenue. How do I hype my live selling events? you might wonder. There are many ways, but we have a few suggestions: Create a Facebook event in advance. In the Facebook event, you can tell your followers a bit about what to expect. It’s a good idea to tease some of your offers, brands, or competitions to make it interesting. People can click “Going,” so they will be notified when you make updates and when you go live. Invite people in a series of newsletters. Why not give your email list a special invite to your live show with a link to your Facebook event? Some people prefer to get the news early on, whereas others just want to know the day before or even an hour in advance. So, please remind your audience more than once. Create a banner or landing page on your webshop. Quickly grab the attention of visitors on your website with a banner at the top of all pages teasing your next live shopping event. Many brands even include an entire section in the navigation menu dedicated to live shopping with information and links to all shows. Besides from hyping your show in advance, remember that hype is also crucial during your live show. While you are live, tease the coming offers or competitions to make sure viewers don’t get bored and leave. Want to know more? Click here to learn much more about live shopping! Book a demo #2 Utilize all your channels at once Most brands and businesses have more than one social channel, e.g. a Facebook page and an Instagram page. But you might even have more pages on each social platform. For instance, if your brand has several local stores, these might all use individual social pages. When you go live, you would want to make the most of your time and effort. So, utilize every single channel by hosting your live shopping shows on each channel at once. When using a live shopping software, you can easily host your live event on multiple channels and platforms at once without additional work. All comments and orders are gathered, so you can manage it all from one platform. For every channel you add, you expand your audience and more viewers will join. And this will boost all social engagement KPI’s and your revenue. All by the click of a mouse. #3 Co-host your live shows with influencers Attracting more viewers to your live events can be challenging, but strong collaborations can take you very far. Inviting a co-host to your live show is extremely impactful, as you instantly reach a completely new and very wide audience. An idea is to collaborate with influencers, since they often have a large and loyal follower base. This means that followers trust the influencer when he or she recommends a product. Of course, you should be mindful to only collaborate with influencers whose follower base matches your target audience. When inviting a co-host to your live show, the best way of utilizing his or her network is by streaming the live show directly on the influencer’s social channels as well as on your own channels. With the right social selling tool, this is set up in no time and viewers can comment and place orders from both channels. And who knows, your live show might go viral. #4 Use digital overlays for a professional look-and-feel While some retailers choose a rather low-key and personal setup, other businesses prefer a professional production that is on-brand. Some live shopping tools offer the option of creating digital overlays in the live stream, which creates a complete and professional shopping experience for viewers. For instance, such digital overlays can be used as: Digital product signs, where you can show an image of the product, the available sizes, as well as the trigger word used to purchase it. This little product sign can be featured on the screen, while the host presents that exact product. Info boxes, where the host of the show can write any type of information, such as information about shipping, big announcements, or whatever the host needs. Competitions and polls that engage viewers and keep them watching for longer. The digital overlays can be used to present the competition and to show the results and the winner. These overlays make it easier for viewers to shop and it creates a much more appealing and entertaining show. This attracts a larger audience, and they are likely coming back for more, when you host your next live event. #5 Keep it personal and interactive Authenticity is key to well-performing live shopping shows. That has been proven over and over again. Therefore, we always suggest keeping your shows very personal and interactive. Be yourself and let viewers know who you are. Afterall, shopping is not just about the product anymore, it’s about the brand and the people behind it. Try out these three tips to make your shows personal and interactive: Ask questions. By asking your viewers questions, you create a sense of community and let people feel heard. Be interested in your customers and listen to their response. It’s not only great for building relationships, but the answers can also prove to be great intel for your business. Bonus: When asking questions, the comment section will completely fire up. This triggers the social algorithm, so your show will be exposed to more people. Answer questions. As you focus on building relations with your viewers, it’s important that you not only ask questions, but that you also answer questions. One of the main purposes of live selling is that viewers can ask questions and receive immediate response. So, when a viewer asks about an item, make sure to talk directly to that viewer when you answer. Mention his or her name and say thank you for all questions and comments. Host competitions and giveaways. Besides from communicating with your audience, you can make your shows interactive, fun, and personal by including competitions and giveaways. When using a live shopping software, you can easily host competitions, where the winner is drawn automatically. And with the right prize at stake, you are sure to get lots of responses. #6 Mix it up with theme-based live events Being successful with live selling requires a consistent effort. But this doesn’t mean that it has to become boring and repetitive. Why not switch it up with special- edition, theme-based live events that stand out from your regular shows? Consider utilizing special occasions and holidays such as: Christmas Black Friday Easter Valentine’s Day. Or focus on certain items, target groups, or brands: The little black dress Your most popular brand Ladies’ Night Popular gift ideas. Try it out and see what works. Sometimes, the results can be quite surprising. #7 “First come, first served” and other exclusive offers There are many physiological initiatives that help drive more conversions. One is the “first come, first served” approach, where you create a sense of urgency, which leads to more revenue. You can implement this strategy in your live sales by promising to reveal some big news within the first 5 minutes of your show. Then viewers will be ready from to get-go. Additionally, you can promise a 10% discount to the first 100 viewers or give a free item away to the first 50 customers during your show. Then, participants are more inclined to place an order quickly. Besides from the “first come, first served” strategy, your live events are also great for promoting exclusive offers or launching new products. Give people a good reason to watch your show, and you will see your social engagement KPI’s skyrocket. In the end, this results in more orders and more revenue.
