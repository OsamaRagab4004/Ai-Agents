Customers are becoming more sophisticated every day. They buy from companies they like, and avoid companies they dislike. They leave bad reviews on social media. And they praise companies that treat them well. If you want to stay in business, you have to focus on customer relationships—not only on selling products. Subscriptions are a great way to establish a relationship with your customers. You’ll go from being a faceless company selling just another product to being a trusted partner. In this article, you are going to learn the key benefits of offering a subscription to your customers.  Why You Should Offer Subscriptions in Your WooCommerce Store  Despite all the talk about the subscription economy, few e-commerce stores are offering subscriptions.  In 2021, 30 percentage of e-commerce companies were “still evaluating” whether to introduce subscriptions in their business model, while 32 percentage were against it.  Let that sink in for a moment — over half of the surveyed companies didn’t have a subscriptions system in place. You can seize this opportunity now and get ahead of the curve.  But why would you? You already have a million things to juggle as a WooCommerce store owner. Product fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, marketing. It’s a lot.

Read on to learn why live shopping has become so popular and find out if it’s a strategy that fits your business. (Hint: If you’re a brand or retailer, it most likely does.) . Live shopping 101  Let’s get down to basics and sort out what live shopping is.  First of all, it goes by many names such as live shopping, live selling, live commerce, social selling, and the list goes on. But no matter what you call it, it describes the act of selling goods through live, shoppable videos online on social media, your own online store, or other channels. Viewers can place an order by writing it in a comment and ask questions in the comment field that hosts can answer immediately. It combines the personal shopping experience from physical stores with the convenience of online shopping.  And for brands and retailers, the results are worth going for: An increase in revenue, massive exposure on social media, and a strengthened, personal bond with customers. But we’ll get to the benefits.  Though live shopping is a rather new concept, it has come to stay. Tech giants such as Amazon, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, Meta, and Twitter are all investing in live shopping, and that’s a very big deal to say the least. It proves that live shopping is on an upward path, not going down any time soon.  “Just three years ago this [livestream shopping] was almost nonexistent in the west, and was a small segment of commerce, just 3.5 percentage of all retail e-commerce, in China. Last year it was a $300 billion segment in China at just under 12 percentage of retail sales, and in 2023, eMarketer estimates it will be 19.4 percentage and worth over $600 billion. The corresponding numbers in the U.S. are $11 billion this year and growth to $25 billion by 2023.” (Analysis in Forbes, 2022.)" } ] }

First of all, for compliance reasons alone, it is important for companies to proceed correctly with revenue recognition. After all, turnover reporting is affected by revenue recognition. Companies must ensure compliance and follow the corresponding legal requirements and standard guidelines (US GAAP, IFRS).  Apart from the fact that companies are obliged to maintain [proper accounting], external stakeholders, such as investors or credit institutions, are also interested in the figures. The sales revenues of a company are regularly of particular interest. For example, comparisons can be made:  - Was the company able to increase its turnover compared to the previous year? - How high are the sales of direct competitors in the same period under review?  Of course, knowledge about revenue is also important for the company itself. Strategic decisions are made, among other things, on the basis of turnover developments.  [Data analyses] are indispensable, especially in the subscription business. For example, an increasing number of subscriptions [can influence revenue development and thus the entire company’s growth]. But in order to successfully manage the business model, decision-makers need detailed knowledge about the realization of income.

According to the revenue recognition principle, companies generate revenue when they have delivered products or provided services to their customers. The recognition does not take place at the time of the payment transaction, but when the service is rendered.  ## **Revenue Recognition for SaaS Accounting**  Example: Assuming that 120 Euros plus VAT are due directly upon the conclusion of a [SaaS] contract, but the user can use the software for one year, the question arises as to how the 120 Euros are to be reported. The SaaS company has not yet (fully) provided the service at the time of payment by the user. What happens if the customer decides to change the package after 6 months? Or if the customer cancels the contract after 10 days? So the question of revenue recognition is not so simple here.  In the case of subscription business models, such as SaaS, this means that the proceeds must be distributed pro rata over the (planned) contract term. This also applies if the fee has to be paid before or at the beginning of the contract term.  Note: Important data is provided by contract management. Conditions, for example, provide a lot of information that has to be processed in accounting. But without modern technologies, the data can hardly be processed correctly and promptly. Therefore, especially SaaS providers need a [software solution] here that also covers the revenue recognition processes." } ] }

Compliance requirements must be adhered to! Companies should be aware of the accounting standards (IFRS 15 / ASC 606) and implement them properly. 2. Subscription providers should use a software solution that facilitates revenue recognition. In this way, accounting processes can be optimized and made IFRS-compliant. 3. The software solution should implement the 5-step model ([IFRS 15] automatically so that the accounting department is unburdened and human errors are reduced. 4. Those who understand the revenue recognition principle can better align their own business model and optimize their own figures. The accounting department can thus provide the decisive data to lead the subscription business to more growth. 5. Revenue recognition brings with it the difficulty that turnover identification and cash flow development are not necessarily identical. Controlling must be sensitized accordingly." } ] }

Monthly or quarterly billing can also be purely usage-based. However, too long periods are counterproductive from an entrepreneurial point of view, as this means that you have to advance payments.  - Tiered Pricing  Incentives need to be created for returning buyers: As consumption increases, better prices can be offered for certain contingents. But also differentiation of product use, for example according to functionality, lends itself very well to graduated prices.  - Fixed flat rate plus usage-based costs  Traditional subscriptions can also include a usage-based component: Amazon Prime is probably the most popular example of access to a product world that is paid for monthly on a fixed and ongoing basis, and where the actual use of products and services is charged additionally. Usage-based billing models are becoming increasingly important in the platform economy.  - Prepaid credit  Another form of metered billing is prepaid credits that are available for the use of products and services. Here it is important to pay particular attention to revenue recognition methods.

More precisely, this regulation applies to any company liable to VAT.This measure was in a start, voted before others, to improve the collection of VAT and better fight against tax fraud. A report by the European Commission estimated that in 2018, nearly 15 billion euros were still missing from the collection of this tax. This discrepancy between expected and collected revenues should therefore be reduced over the years thanks to rigorous control of the financial activities of companies. In order to obtain a better view of the cash flows of European companies, it is now mandatory for them to use certified accounting and management software.  Digital technology has brought accounting to a new stage of evolution. Companies have been operating on two levels, one physical and the other digital, potentially resulting in the opacity of certain operations. While digitalization has continued to progress, confidence in the digital world has grown and naturally become the preferred environment for forward-looking companies. Therefore, a standardization of these new practices will be the next step, in order to make the activities of organizations that may be subject to a tax audit readable.  Indeed, digital technology approach stands with great opportunities, however it can exploit various loopholes and anti-fraud legislation fights against that. 4 main compliance criteria must be considered. In the law text, this imperative is precisely formulated as follows: “Any person liable for value added tax (VAT) who records payments from customers using accounting or management software or a cash register system must use a software or a system that satisfies the conditions of **inalterability**, **security**, **conservation** and **archiving** of data with a view to control by the tax authorities. Let’s review these 4 main principles of Anti-Fraud Law while examining how BILLWERK+ has respected them." } ] }

How does the anti-fraud law enforce the principles of inalterability and security in billing software, and what measures does BILLWERK+ implement to comply with these requirements? with writing style Professional and Analytical with tone Formal and Authoritative" }, { "role": "assistant", "content": "## Anti-Fraud Law: **Inalterability**  It is specified that “the software […] shall record all original settlement data. It must keep this original data recorded and make it unalterable”. The idea behind this concept of inalterability is that it is not possible to go back to a document that has already been validated to correct certain fields.  This does not prevent an invoice from being modified following an error or a change in the transaction. The inalterability just ensures that the document keeps track of its modifications or cancellations. For instance, this could be within the document itself, with successive “plus” and “minus” operations that are added as modifications are made. With BILLWERK+, the documents themselves represent the history of a transaction: for example, when you want to correct an invoice that has already been sent, or even cancel it, you can create a credit note that will then be attached to the first invoice.  ## Anti-Fraud Law: **Securing**  It is mentioned that “the software […] must secure the original data, the record of the modified data and the data allowing the production of the issued supporting documents”. Data protection is indeed more than ever at the heart of the various digital challenges.  As a solution developed within Salesforce, BILLWERK+ benefits from a trusted framework to host your billing data in an ultra-secure cloud. The text of the anti-fraud law also calls for vigilance on the part of your own teams when using the software, particularly during training periods. BILLWERK+ protects you doubly against these hazards thanks to its licensing system. Distributed sparingly, they grant a set of authorizations according to the position held in the company.  In addition, the free trial version of BILLWERK + is also an ideal test environment to familiarize yourself with the solution while keeping your data secured." } ] }

It must ensure the integrity over time of the archives produced and their conformity to the initial settlement data from which they are created.” In the case of invoicing, this requirement can be found in the L123-22 article of the French Commercial Code, which requires that accounting documents should be kept for a period of 10 years.  Billwerk+ naturally stores all your documents in the Salesforce CRM cloud, thus avoiding any possible loss or additional costs generated by physical storage. Nevertheless, if wanted, it is possible to extract your billing data in order to ensure a double archiving.  The 4 points raised by the anti-fraud law are therefore factors of transparency and should not be considered as barriers to evolve. They are real levers for improvement for companies that have timidly embarked on the path of digitalization. And in the particular case of invoicing, they are precisely part of the arguments for changing software to take advantage of what technology has to offer.  To strengthen the fight against fraud, the anti-fraud law also brings various obligations to invoice electronically by 2024. [BILLWERK+ is] closely monitoring these developments in order to offer you a solution that is simultaneously in line with the legislation and the most innovative trends that the digital doors are opening." } ] }

Pay for only what you use. This is the very simple principle behind usage-based billing. As a logical extension of the subscription economy model, the usage economy has been increasingly successful over the past few years, especially in B2B.  As popular as it may be, the subscription economy faces some limitations. Who would pay a fixed monthly subscription fee for a service whose use fluctuates from month to month? Well, you don’t have to look too far to convince yourself otherwise. Just have fun comparing a company’s peak activity in August and then in September. It’s usually easy to do the maths! Consumption-based billing provides a practical solution to such irregularities regarding a given service’s use. It’s flexible and can be adapted to all types of companies. Pricing can be based on the number of users for an application, the time spent on software or the volume of data consumed for a storage system. Consumption-based billing: a hybrid business model?  When it comes to pay-as-you-go, there are two main models:  This second model is more attractive for the client, but also more risky for the service provider. Actually, it’s difficult to accurately estimate revenues when they vary each month according to customer consumption. For greater comfort and better control of their cash flow, most companies therefore tend to favor a hybrid formula between subscription and usership economy." } ] }

On the one hand, service providers are trying to stand out by offering increasingly innovative services, in line with consumers’ desire for flexibility. On the other hand, customers aspire to greater price transparency, while enjoying quality services. The way is thus paved for pay-per-use billing.  **Customer benefits**  The main interest of consumption-based billing lies in the savings that a customer is able to make. Indeed, this economic model advocates **cost transparency**. A customer can thus define and **adjust his expenses without having to worry**. Consequently, there is **no risk of unpleasant surprises** at the end of the month. He only pays for what he has used and makes sure that he gets the best return on his investment.  Similarly, it’s much easier for a customer to test a new service through the economy of use. There is no question of making a bet on the future. If the service does not provide satisfaction and proves to be unprofitable, the investment made remains under control. This is why this limitation of financial risks is particularly appreciated by clients seeking to develop their business through innovative services.  **Business benefits**  In order to attract and retain new prospects, a company needs to provide *the best possible experience*. With this in mind, pay-per-use billing **helps to build [trust with customers]**. By analyzing a customer’s consumption data, the company can, for example :  - warn a user that his consumption threshold is about to be exceeded; - make a promotional gesture on a product or service that is widely appreciated by a customer - offer another service that seems to be more appropriate to the customer’s needs.  These actions may seem trivial, but they contribute to **[strengthening customer satisfaction]. The more satisfied a consumer is, the more they will become attached to your services and recommend them. Is this a virtuous circle?  Offering pay-per-use services also help a company **[generate additional revenue]. Coupled with a classic subscription, these additional services billed by usage are an effective lever to expand the offer subscribed by customers.  To sum up, more and more companies are adopting usage-based billing as part of their business model. As it can be applied to most business sectors ([IT]industry, etc.), pay-per-use services attract a wide range of customers who are used to working on a just-in-time basis." } ] }
